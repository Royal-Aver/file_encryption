With the help of the library pyaescrypt this program can encrypt and decrypt your files. I also used Path from library pathlib to give the encrypted/decrypted file the filename of the original file.

Copy the file to be encrypted/decrypted to the folder files.
If you need to encrypt the file, then comment out the code below #decrypt .
If you need to decrypt the file, then comment out the code between # encrypt and #decrypt.
